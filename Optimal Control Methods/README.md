## Analytical/ Planning Methods <a id ="42"></a>
Optimal control problems can be solved using analytical methods, such as the Pontryagin's Minimum
Principle (PMP), which is a necessary condition for optimality. The PMP states that
the Hamiltonian function, which is a combination of the state and control variables, must be
minimized with respect to the control variable.

### Variational Calculus <a id ="43"></a>
Variational calculus is a method used to find the optimal solution to a problem by minimizing or maximizing a
functional. It is used in optimal control problems where the goal is to find the optimal control input that
minimizes or maximizes a performance criterion.

### Minimum Principle <a id ="44"></a>
The minimum principle is a method used to solve optimal control problems. It states that the optimal control input
is the one that minimizes the Hamiltonian function, which is a function of the state, control input, and the adjoint variable.
The adjoint variable is a function that is used to compute the gradient of the performance criterion with respect
to the control input.

### Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation <a id ="45"></a>
The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is a partial differential equation that is used to solve optimal control problems. It is a dynamic programming approach that computes the optimal control input by minimizing the performance criterion over a finite horizon.

## Learning Methods <a id ="46"></a>
Learning methods, such as reinforcement learning, can be used to solve optimal control problems. These methods
learn the optimal control input by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards
or penalties.

### Dynamic Programming <a id ="47"></a>
Dynamic programming is a method used to solve optimal control problems by breaking down the problem into smaller
sub-problems and solving each sub-problem recursively. It is used in reinforcement learning to compute the
optimal control input by minimizing the cumulative reward over a finite horizon.

### Model-Based Reinforcment Learning <a id ="48"></a>
Model-based reinforcement learning is a method used to solve optimal control problems by learning a model of the
environment and using it to compute the optimal control input. It is used in applications where the environment
is complex and difficult to model.

### Model-Free Reinforcement Learning <a id ="49"></a>
Model-free reinforcement learning is a method used to solve optimal control problems by learning the optimal control
input directly from experience without learning a model of the environment. It is used in applications where the
environment is simple and easy to model.
