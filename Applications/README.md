## Case Study 1: Trajectory Optimization <a id ="43"></a>

### Problem Formulation <a id ="43"></a>
The problem is to find the optimal trajectory for a spacecraft to travel from Earth to Mars. The spacecraft
has a limited amount of fuel, and the trajectory must be optimized to minimize the time of travel.
The problem can be formulated as a nonlinear programming problem.

### System Design <a id ="43"></a>
The system will be designed to optimize the trajectory of a spacecraft. The system will take in the initial
position, velocity, and acceleration of the spacecraft, as well as the target position and velocity. The
system will then use a numerical optimization algorithm to find the optimal trajectory that minimizes the
time of flight.

### Control Implementation <a id ="43"></a>
The control implementation will be based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach. The MPC will
use a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to optimize the control inputs at each time step. The
optimization problem will be formulated as a quadratic program, which will be solved using a
quadratic programming solver.

## Case Study 2: Adaptive Control <a id ="43"></a>

### Problem Formulation <a id ="43"></a>
The problem is to design an adaptive control system for a nonlinear system with unknown parameters.
The system will be modeled using a nonlinear state-space equation, and the control objective will be to
track a reference trajectory.

### System Design <a id ="43"></a>
The system will be designed to adapt to changes in the environment. The system will take in sensor data
from the environment and use this data to update the control inputs in real-time. The system will use
machine learning algorithms to learn the dynamics of the environment and adapt the control inputs
accordingly.

### Control Implementation <a id ="43"></a>
The control implementation will be based on a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) approach. The
MRAC will use a least squares estimator to estimate the parameters of the plant model. The
estimated parameters will then be used to compute the control inputs using a linear quadratic
regulator (LQR).

## Case Study 3: Stochastic Control<a id ="43"></a>
### Problem Formulation <a id ="43"></a>
The problem is to design a stochastic control system for a system with random disturbances. The system
will be modeled using a stochastic state-space equation, and the control objective will be to minimize
the expected value of a cost function.

### System Design <a id ="43"></a>
The system will be designed to handle stochastic disturbances. The system will take in sensor data from
the environment and use this data to update the control inputs in real-time. The system will use a
Kalman filter to estimate the state of the system and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to
compute the control inputs.

### Control Implementation <a id ="43"></a>
The control implementation will be based on a stochastic linear quadratic regulator (SLQR) approach.
The SLQR will use a Kalman filter to estimate the state of the system and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to compute the control inputs. The SLQR will also use a stochastic optimization algorithm to optimize the control inputs in real-time.
