# Optimal Control Methods

The aim of this project is to explore and compare the different methods of solving optimal control problems.

This project will focus on apply different optimal control methods on different types of systems with the goal.
The optimal control methods implemented in this projects are categorised based on how much information about the system we have as Planning Methods, Model-Based Learning, and Model-Free Learning.
The systems modelled in this project are categorised based on how much information about the system we have as Deterministic systems, and Stochastic Systems.

We have modified a certain bit in the environment.
